# Microservices Project Status

## Project Goal

Create a product microservice and order microservice using Spring Boot with proper architecture, communication, and best practices.

## Current Status

- [x] Project initialization
- [x] Product microservice setup
- [x] Order microservice setup
- [x] Benefit Estimation microservice setup
- [x] Payout microservice setup
- [x] Database configuration
- [x] API endpoints implementation
- [x] Service communication setup
- [x] Docker configuration
- [x] Documentation

## Completed Tasks

1. ✅ Created product microservice with:

   - Product entity and repository
   - Product controller with CRUD operations
   - Product service layer
   - Database configuration (H2 for development)

2. ✅ Created order microservice with:

   - Order entity and repository
   - Order controller with CRUD operations
   - Order service layer
   - Integration with product service

3. ✅ Setup inter-service communication:

   - REST client configuration using WebClient
   - Stock reservation during order creation

4. ✅ Added proper error handling and validation

5. ✅ Created Docker configurations for both services

6. ✅ Added comprehensive documentation

## Next Steps

- Test the microservices locally
- Add unit and integration tests
- Implement service discovery (Eureka)
- Add API Gateway
- Implement circuit breaker patterns
- Add benefit calculation algorithms
- Implement payment gateway integration
