## üîó Related Services

Once Product Service is working, you can test the complete workflow:

1. **Product Service** (Port 8081) - ‚úÖ You are here
2. **Order Service** (Port 8082) - Creates orders using products
3. **Benefit Estimation Service** (Port 8083) - Calculates benefits from orders
4. **Payout Service** (Port 8084) - Processes payouts from benefits

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port Already in Use**
   ```bash
   # Check what's using port 8081
   lsof -i :8081
   # Kill the process if needed
   kill -9 <PID>
   ```

2. **Docker Issues**
   ```bash
   # Check Docker status
   docker --version
   docker ps
   
   # Restart Docker if needed
   # On macOS: Restart Docker Desktop
   ```

3. **Java Version Issues**
   ```bash
   # Check Java version
   java -version
   # Should be Java 17 or higher
   ```

4. **Maven Issues**
   ```bash
   # Clean and rebuild
   mvn clean package -DskipTests
   ```

### Health Check
```bash
# Check if service is running
curl -X GET http://localhost:8081/api/products

# Expected: Empty array [] or list of products
```
